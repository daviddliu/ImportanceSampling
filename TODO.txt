# Done
+ Figured out the nature and scope of the problem
+ Hobolth 2008
+ True likelihoods given by the coalescent program for certain datasets
+ Four Russians Paper: Gusfield 97

# Code TODO
+ Try to see deviations from the true probabilities of each edge

# Reading TODO
+ Stephens-Donnelly 2000: Importance sampling
+ Griffiths-Jenkins-Song 2007: Two locus
+ Jenkins-Song 2011: Recurrent mutations

# Ideas
+ Try to use some shortcut similar to Four Russians to reduce the space of inputs
+ Consider a model other than the standard coalescent
+ Is there some sort of shortcut if you consider things beyond just some static number of mutatino events

# Reading List
	## Yun Song two loci paper
	## Later: Jenkins and Hein, Genetics
	## Griffiths two-locus model
